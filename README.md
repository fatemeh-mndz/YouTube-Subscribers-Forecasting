# YouTube Subscriber Forecasting Project

This project involves the development of a forecasting model to predict future YouTube subscriber growth over the next 30 days. The models used for prediction include both **Dense** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks, leveraging cross-validation to calculate the mean of each model's loss across multiple folds. 

The detailed results of the model predictions and the corresponding performance metrics (Mean Absolute Error - MAE) are outlined below.

## Project Overview

In this project, we used a combination of **LSTM** and **Dense neural networks** to predict future YouTube subscriber counts for a 30-day period. Multiple model configurations were tested to compare their performance. Cross-validation was performed to compute the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** for each model, providing an average measure of the model's predictive accuracy across all folds.

All results, including predicted subscriber counts and performance metrics, are summarized in the sections below.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability of both **LSTM** and **Dense networks** to forecast YouTube subscriber growth with relatively low Mean Absolute Error. 



- The **LSTM 30-7 model** had the lowest error overall with an MAE of **0.0959** üèÜ, making it the best performer in terms of accuracy.
- The **Dense 30-7 model** predicted a higher subscriber increase, but had a slightly higher error (MAE: **0.1185**) compared to LSTM 30-7.

The results show that both architectures can be valuable in predicting subscriber trends, with LSTM models potentially better suited for capturing sequential patterns, and Dense models providing strong overall performance.
